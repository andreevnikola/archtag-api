# ArchTag

**ArchTag** is a company that provides an **SASS** with which you can _manage_, _give work_ and spectate what your employers are working on, if they are filling up their quotes, when they come and go from work and so much more. This project is created specially for the construction branch.

#### This Repo is the ArchTag API repo. Here is the primary API monolith of ArchTag. This Server will be running with at least three replicas.
